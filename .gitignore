# .gitignore

# This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
# It helps keep your repository clean by preventing large or sensitive files
# (like compiled code, dependency folders, or environment variables)
# from being accidentally committed.

# --- Node.js Dependencies ---
# These patterns ignore the 'node_modules' directories, which contain all
# installed third-party packages. These should not be committed to Git
# as they can be reinstalled using 'npm install' based on package.json.
node_modules/              # Ignores 'node_modules' in the project root.
cli-tool/node_modules/     # Ignores 'node_modules' specifically within the 'cli-tool' directory.
auction-api/node_modules/  # Ignores 'node_modules' specifically within the 'auction-api' directory.

# --- Environment Variables ---
# These patterns ignore '.env' files, which typically contain sensitive
# information (like database credentials, API keys) that should not be
# exposed in a public repository.
.env                       # Ignores '.env' file in the project root.
cli-tool/.env              # Ignores '.env' file specifically within the 'cli-tool' directory.
auction-api/.env           # Ignores '.env' file specifically within the 'auction-api' directory.

# --- Logs ---
# These patterns ignore various log files generated by npm or other processes.
# Log files are usually temporary and specific to a local development environment.
npm-debug.log* # Ignores npm debug logs (e.g., npm-debug.log, npm-debug.log.1).
yarn-debug.log* # Ignores yarn debug logs.
.log                       # Ignores any file ending with '.log'.
